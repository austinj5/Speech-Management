# Speech Management Backend

This is my implementation of the backend for a speech management system. It allows users to centrally store their speeches, and then perform CRUD operations on them or search for them.

This application is built using Springboot, Java, and H2 for data storage.


## Features

- View all speeches along with their metadata
- Add, edit, and delete speeches
- Search speeches by:
    - Author
    - Date Range
    - Text snippet
    - Keyword
- Lightweight and efficient for small-scale usage


## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- H2 Database
- JPA/Hibernate
